## A example of mixing ImGui and SDL2

### Tested environment

1. OS: Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop
2. OpenGL: 4.6.0

This is a demo of using ImGui in your SDL2 game. It should help if anyone like me got trouble of trying to use ImGui in their SDL2 game. 

It should also help if you've been to https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1116
